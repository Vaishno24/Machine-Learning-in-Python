ML Models implementation in python language

The Breast cancer dataset is form the state wisconsin containing 9 features with 699 instances.

The ML algorithms used are:
1) K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
2) Linear Discriminant Analysis
3) Logistic Regression Classifier
4) Guassian NaiveBayes Classifier
5) SVM Classifier

You can also see the Analysis of performance of above implemented algorithms and the presentation document explains the concept part behind these algorithms.
