ML Models implementation in python language

Here we have two breast cancer datasets to understand the working of the algorithm, one of which is form the state wisconsin containing 9 features with 699 instances and the other has 30 features with 569 instances.

The ML algorithms used are K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression Classifier.
